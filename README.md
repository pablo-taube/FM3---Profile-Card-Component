## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project was stimulating to build because I realized, during the process, that sometimes we need to take a break, breath, and restart. I had to rewrite the CSS from the beginning because, at some point, I was not understanding what I was doing and why it was not working the way it was supposed to. And I'm glad I did it. When rewriting the code, I decided to better organize and create sections to separate what I was styling, and by doing that, I could understand the code and the results. 

Even with this situation, I found myself excited and determined to find a solution.

The final result (so far) is not perfect, but I am content with the progress I've made.


### Continued development

The more I code, the more I realize that I have to keep working on it, so I intend to keep learning and training CSS and learn new languages such as JavaScript, Node, and React.
